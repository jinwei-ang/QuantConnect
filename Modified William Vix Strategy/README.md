# Modified William Vix Strategyy

Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX)  has become a very popular measure of market risk since it was introduced in 1993. The VIX, which is derived from the implied volatility of stock index options, is intended to represent tradersâ€™ expectations of volatility over the next 30 days. 

In this strategy, we look to hold long position in SPY when VIX is below 2 standard deviation and rotate capital to bond (TLT) when VIX exceeds 2 standard deviation is a rolling 22-day period. There is a wait out period before reassessing whether to re-enter long position in SPY. The wait out period is calculated based on the volatity of SPY.
